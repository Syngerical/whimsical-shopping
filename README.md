# whimsical-shopping
This project uses the JC Penney API to view the clothing catalogue and stores all of the clothing that match certain specifications such as mens clothing, womens clothing, shirts, pants, etc. Then outfits are randomly generated by selecting 1 product from each type of clothing. Using web scraping, I retrieve an image of each product from the JC Penney website and then display them to the user, presenting them with their new outfit.
